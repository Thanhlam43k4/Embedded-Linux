# Embedded-Linux
Embedded Linux is nothing but the usage of Linux kernel and other open-source software development tools such as open-source libraries in embedded systems applications development. Hence, Instead of using a bare-metal embedded systems approach where we have to write every piece of the software ourselves, we make use of the Linux operating system to design embedded applications.


Embedded Linux operating process includes:
    Boot Loader
    Device tree
    Root file systems
    System program
    Applications
    Kernel
    Cross development toolchain.
